'''
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The relative order of the elements may be changed.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        k = []
        for i in nums:
            if i!=val:
                k.append(i)
            else:
                nums.remove(i)
        nums = k
        n = print(len(k),', nums = ',nums)
        return n
